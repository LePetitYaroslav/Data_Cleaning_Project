# Data Cleaning Project  

## Overview  
This project focuses on cleaning raw data to prepare it for further analysis. The cleaning process improves the data's consistency, accuracy, and usability.  

## Key Tasks  
1. **Removing Duplicates**  
   Identifying and eliminating duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.  

2. **Standardizing Data**  
   Formatting values (e.g., text cases, numerical precision) to maintain consistency across the dataset.  

3. **Handling Null Values**  
   - Identifying and addressing missing values.  
   - Filling, replacing, or removing null entries based on context.  

4. **Deleting/Modifying Optional Rows or Columns**  
   Removing irrelevant or unnecessary rows and columns to streamline the dataset for analysis.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Database Management**: MySQL  
- **Query Language**: SQL  

## Purpose  
This project demonstrates key techniques for effective data cleaning, forming the foundation for deeper data analysis and visualization.  

## Next Steps  
After completing the cleaning process, the prepared data will be used for advanced analytics, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.
